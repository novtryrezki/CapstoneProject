<h1 align="center">ANIMAL SCOPE</h1>

Nowadays, extinction and scarcity of animals often occur. The lack of human awareness to maintain and protect nature is one of the causes. Humans unknowingly often destroy nature and the habitat of various animals by littering, cutting down trees in the forest, and many others. In this era of technological development, we must be able to take advantage of technological advances to help us overcome this case. Our team is working to develop an animal recognition application that can help us understand more about animals and increase human awareness about the importance of maintaining and protecting nature. In addition, this application can be a very useful tool in education, especially for children. By getting to know animals, children can learn about different species of animals, their way of life, their living environment and create human awareness to maintain and protect nature.
